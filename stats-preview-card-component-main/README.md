## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

Build the layout with HTML semantics, set the variables, the layout and then paint the different parts ajusting the padding/margin between elements, and finally move to mobile display.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (still not enough)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS custom properties
- mixin
  <!-- - CSS Grid -->
  <!-- - Mobile-first workflow -->
  <!-- - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library -->
  <!-- - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework


- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles -->

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned how to use properly flexbox and mixin to avoid having too much. I should make more semantic usage.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}

@mixin space($p, $mb, $font) {
  padding: 0 $p;
  margin-bottom: $mb;
  font-family: $font, sans-serif;
}

/* reset trick */

* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
